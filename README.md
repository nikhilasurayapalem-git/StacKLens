The Cloud &amp; AI Subscription Hub is a personal-project product that provides a unified way to view, track, and manage subscriptions across AI tools and cloud services (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, AWS). The goal is to give users a single place to understand their total spend, and receive basic insights on where they might save money.
